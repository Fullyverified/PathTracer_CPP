Remaking my PathTracer in CPP, hopefully with multithreading.  
I have finished implementing both BVH tree consturction and traversal. Multithreaded tree construction is only faster for scenes with hundreds of objects, but both that and ST are functonal.
![BVH Tree Traversal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e06606b0-830a-4ddc-aae1-cfbb3a9738b1)  
BVH creation is 220x faster and traversal is 34x faster :D
